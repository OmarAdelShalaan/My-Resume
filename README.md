# Projects 
-Infotainment System, NTI Graduation Project (May 2024)
	Comprises two ECUs:
	- First ECU: features a user interface for door status, temperature monitoring, and media playback. It integrates Qt Framework, QML, and REST API, and utilizes Jamendo API for online song search.
	- Second ECU: serves as a server, connecting to temperature sensors and limit switches for real-time door state and temperature sensing. It leverages Yocto for image customization and utilizes device drivers for GPIO and I2C interfaces.
	Both ECUs communicate seamlessly via socket programming.
- ## ALX SE Foundation
  	- ### Simple Shell Project (Jan 2024) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/simple_shell)
  	  	  The Simple Shell Project for ALX SE Foundations is about building a command-line shell in C that
		  handles single-word commands, errors for missing executables, (Ctrl+D) for end of file, commands with
		  arguments, PATH variable, exit command, env built-in for environment display, cd with directory
		  options, and variable replacement.

  	- ### Employee Record System Project (Dec 2023) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/C-and-Embedded-C-NTI-Course/tree/main/Employee_Record_System_Project)
  	 		The Employee Record System streamlines managing employee data with features for adding, deleting,
			modifying, and viewing employee information, along with an option to view all records and exit the
			system.
- ##  Voice Controlled Elevator (Sep2022 â€“ Jul2023) (Graduation Project) (Excellence) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/Elevator-Voice-Control-System) 
		Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant push to minimize virus transmission, especially
		in confined spaces like elevators. This led to a shift towards voice-controlled elevator systems, reducing
		the need for physical contact with control buttons and promoting safer interactions.
  		AVR (Interrupt + UART) + Keypad + Voice Recognition Module v3 + DC Motor 
- ##  Mastering Embedded System (Learn-In-Depth) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/Mastering-Embedded-System)
	-   ###  Pressure Controller (Apr 2023) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/Mastering-Embedded-System/tree/main/Projects/Pressure_Controller)
			The Pressure Controller project on GitHub includes essential startup code, a linker script, and a Makefile
			for building the embedded system. It also integrates Proteus for debugging/simulation and utilizes TTool
			for system analysis/design documentation.
			(Startup.c + LinkerScript.ld + makefile) (Proteus Debugger / Simulation) 
			(TTool Requirements Diagram / System Analysis /Sequence Diagram / System Design) 
	-   ###  Student Information Management (Apr 2023) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/Mastering-Embedded-System/tree/main/Projects/Student_Information_Management)
			The "Student Information Management" project hosted on GitHub is built using the C language and
			features functionality for adding, finding, deleting, updating, displaying student information, and exiting
			the system. It comprised more functions to manage student data effectively.

	-   ###  On-demand Traffic light control (Sep 2022) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/Embedded-Systems-Professional-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/On-demand%20Traffic%20light%20control)
			The Traffic Lights System includes standard red, yellow, and green signals for vehicles, with an
			added on-demand crosswalk button to ensure safe pedestrian crossings.
			AVR (MCAL: DIO / Timer / External Interrupt) (ECUAL: Delay / LED) 
	-   ###  Payment Application (Aug 2022) [Link](https://github.com/OmarAdelShalaan/Embedded-Systems-Professional-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/Payment%20Application)
			The Payment Application project, built in C for embedded systems, manages transactions like preauthorization, VOID, sale, and refund.
			SALE deducts funds, REFUND returns them post-return. Preauthorization holds funds, while VOID cancels transactions (e.g., incorrect amounts).
			The project cludes modules for card, terminal, and server, and application logic.
